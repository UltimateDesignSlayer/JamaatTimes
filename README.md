# JamaatTimes
Tell times of Jamaat at local mosque (St Area Mosque)

# Requirements

This will be a simple web app that lists out the prayer times at my local mosque. The prayer times change roughly once every couple weeks. The trick here is to have the ability to quickly and securely update the list. The app data will be updated every minute by a recurring ajax get. Still deciding where this data will be though....
